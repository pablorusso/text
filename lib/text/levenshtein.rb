#
# Levenshtein distance algorithm implementation for Ruby, with UTF-8 support.
#
# The Levenshtein distance is a measure of how similar two strings s and t are,
# calculated as the number of deletions/insertions/substitutions needed to
# transform s into t. The greater the distance, the more the strings differ.
#
# The Levenshtein distance is also sometimes referred to as the
# easier-to-pronounce-and-spell 'edit distance'.

module Levenshtein

  # Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings +str1+ and +str2+.
  #
  # The optional argument max_distance can reduce the number of iterations by
  # stopping if the Levenshtein distance exceeds this value. This increases
  # performance where it is only necessary to compare the distance with a
  # reference value instead of calculating the exact distance.
  #
  # The distance is calculated in terms of Unicode codepoints. Be aware that
  # this algorithm does not perform normalisation: if there is a possibility
  # of different normalised forms being used, normalisation should be performed
  # beforehand.
